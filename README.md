# SoundSync
<p align="justify">
SoundSync is an Android app that allows Youtube music sharing between group members, adding or removing songs to a shared playlist.
This app can be useful not only in a car trip, in which the passengers can add songs from Youtube to a playlist and then a central device (connected to the car) would play the songs, but also at parties, where multiple people can DJ their favorite songs and create an amazing environment to everyone! <br />
No more giving your smartphone and PIN code to everyone in the room to play the songs!

You can create a group by clicking on "CREATE GROUP" and entering a group name. <br />
There is also the possibility to join an existing group by entering a group name or by pressing the QR Code image and scanning the QRCode card from someone in that group. To bring up the QRCode card simply click on the top right icon with a person with a + or click the whole SoundSync logo. <br />
You can add songs by clicking on the bottom button "ADD" and writing the song's name. Once you do this, your song is on the playlist! You can choose different songs by clicking on them on the list. The songs will start playing automatically one after the other. <br />
If someone added a song and it's not what they were looking for or it's not what people want to hear, simply click on the trashcan icon on the list! It will automatically be removed from everyone's devices! <br />
The playlist will remain on the group even if everyone is out of it, so you can rejoin once more to listen to the amazing songs that everyone brought up, together.
